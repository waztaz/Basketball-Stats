Week 1: Implemented Home Page framework using Bootstrap. Used bootstraps 
built in classes to make dynamic home page with slide show of pictures describing function of each
component of the application. Made dummy links which will eventually link to login pages. Will also add
some additional design changes in following week. Files: HomeStaticContent/home.html -- html chasis for home page.
