Week 2 commit:
Work on branches: Frontend_Raza

Created a Schedule page and incorporated Javascript functionality to input time and team.
Had to make significant changes in the javascript functions given with the bootstrap to provide the functionality where we could view different teams and their scores.

Week 1: 

Implemented the login/registration page using bootstrap.
Worked on a logo for the App.
Most of my time was spent reading about Google OAuth2 and tried to include a google sign in button however it requires a web server to display properly so has been commented out for now.
