Commit 1 (Due 2/15)

This week, I completed the following:
Reading: reviewing the django style to keep application organized
Programming: Primarily on branch 'raj' 
-Created django application, added app 'roster', created an admin and configured it to edit the application
-Within roster, I edited urls.py, views.py, and models.py to add pages for players, coaches, and teams

Notes: Eventually, we plan to move to Microsoft SQL Server as mentioned in our documentation. However, since Django has built in SQLite, we will use this for development purposes. I have plans to migrate to Azure later in the development process.
